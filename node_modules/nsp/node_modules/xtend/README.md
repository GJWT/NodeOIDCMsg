Extend like a boss

xtend is a basic utility library which allows you to extend an object by appending all of the properties from each object in a list. When there are identical properties, the right-most property takes precedence.

## Examples

```js
var extend = require("xtend")

// extend returns a new object. Does not mutate arguments
var combination = extend({
    a: "a",
    b: 'c'
}, {
    b: "b"
})
// { a: "a", b: "b" }
```
