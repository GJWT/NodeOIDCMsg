# strip-bom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/strip-bom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/strip-bom)

> Strip UTF-8 [byte order mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8) (BOM) from a string/buffer

From Wikipedia:

> The Unicode Standard permits the BOM in UTF-8, but does not require nor recommend its use. Byte order has no meaning in UTF-8.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save strip-bom
```


## Usage

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var stripBom = require('strip-bom');

stripBom('\uFEFFunicorn');
//=> 'unicorn'

stripBom(fs.readFileSync('unicorn.txt'));
//=> 'unicorn'
```
