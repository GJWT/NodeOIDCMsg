```




Usage
-----

1) Import the module:

```js
import isSubset from 'is-subset/module';

// …or:
var isSubset = require('is-subset');
```

2) These are true:

```js
isSubset(
  {a: 1, b: 2},
  {a: 1}
);

isSubset(
  {a: 1, b: {c: 3, d: 4}, e: 5},
  {a: 1, b: {c: 3}}
);

isSubset(
  {a: 1, bcd: [1, 2, 3]},
  {a: 1, bcd: [1, 2]}
);
```

…and these are false:

```js
isSubset(
  {a: 1},
  {a: 2}
);

isSubset(
  {a: 1},
  {a: 1, b: 2}
);

isSubset(
  {a: 1, bcd: [1, 2, 3]},
  {a: 1, bcd: [1, 3]}
);
```

API
===

###  *isSubset*(*superset*, *subset*)  ###

Check if an object is contained within another object.

Returns `true` if:
- all enumerable keys of *subset* are also enumerable in *superset*, and
- every value assigned to an enumerable key of *subset* strictly equals the value assigned to the same key of *superset* – or is a subset of it.

**Parameters:**
- `Object` *superset*
- `Object` *subset*

**Return value:**
- `Boolean`
