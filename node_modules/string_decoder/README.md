***Node-core string_decoderstring_decoder for userland***

This package is a mirror of the string_decoder implementation in Node-core.

Full documentation may be found on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/dist/v7.8.0/docs/api/).

As of version 1.0.0 **string_decoder** uses semantic versioning.

## Previous versions

Previous version numbers match the versions found in Node core, e.g. 0.10.24 matches Node 0.10.24, likewise 0.11.10 matches Node 0.11.10.

## Update

The *build/* directory contains a build script that will scrape the source from the [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) repo given a specific Node version.
