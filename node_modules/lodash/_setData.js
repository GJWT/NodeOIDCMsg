 * Sets metadata for `func`.

 * period of time, it will trip its breaker and transition to an identity
 * function to avoid garbage collection pauses in V8. See
 * [V8 issue 2070](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2070)
 * for more details.

 * @param {Function} func The function to associate metadata with.
 * @param {*} data The metadata.
 * @returns {Function} Returns `func`.
