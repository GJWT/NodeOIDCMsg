/**
 * Creates a function that performs a partial deep comparison between a given
 * object and `source`, returning `true` if the given object has equivalent
 * property values, else `false`.
 *
 * **Note:** The created function is equivalent to `_.isMatch` with `source`
 * partially applied.
 *
 * Partial comparisons will match empty array and empty object `source`
 * values against any array or object value, respectively. See `_.isEqual`
 * for a list of supported value comparisons.

 * @category Util
 * @param {Object} source The object of property values to match.
 * @returns {Function} Returns the new spec function.
 * @example
 *
 * var objects = [
 *   { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3 },
 *   { 'a': 4, 'b': 5, 'c': 6 }
