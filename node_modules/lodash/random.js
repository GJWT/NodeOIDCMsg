/**
 * Produces a random number between the inclusive `lower` and `upper` bounds.
 * If only one argument is provided a number between `0` and the given number
 * is returned. If `floating` is `true`, or either `lower` or `upper` are
 * floats, a floating-point number is returned instead of an integer.
 *
 * **Note:** JavaScript follows the IEEE-754 standard for resolving
 * floating-point values which can produce unexpected results.
