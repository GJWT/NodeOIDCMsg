 * Checks if `value` is a pristine native function.
 *
 * **Note:** This method can't reliably detect native functions in the presence
 * of the core-js package because core-js circumvents this kind of detection.
 * Despite multiple requests, the core-js maintainer has made it clear: any
 * attempt to fix the detection will be obstructed. As a result, we're left
 * with little choice but to throw an error. Unfortunately, this also affects
 * packages, like [babel-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-polyfill),
 * which rely on core-js.
