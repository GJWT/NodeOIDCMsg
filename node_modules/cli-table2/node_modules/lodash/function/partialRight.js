 *
 * The `_.partialRight.placeholder` value, which defaults to `_` in monolithic
 * builds, may be used as a placeholder for partially applied arguments.
 *
 * **Note:** This method does not set the "length" property of partially
 * applied functions.

 * @memberOf _
 * @category Function
 * @param {Function} func The function to partially apply arguments to.
 * @param {...*} [partials] The arguments to be partially applied.
 * @returns {Function} Returns the new partially applied function.
 * @example
 *
 * var greet = function(greeting, name) {
 *   return greeting + ' ' + name;
 * };

 * var greetFred = _.partialRight(greet, 'fred');
