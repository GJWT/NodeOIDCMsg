/**
 * This method is like `_.sortedIndex` except that it returns the highest

 * @category Array
 * @param {Array} array The sorted array to inspect.
 * @param {*} value The value to evaluate.
 * @param {Function|Object|string} [iteratee=_.identity] The function invoked
 *  per iteration.
 * @param {*} [thisArg] The `this` binding of `iteratee`.
 * @returns {number} Returns the index at which `value` should be inserted
 *  into `array`.
 * @example
 *
 * _.sortedLastIndex([4, 4, 5, 5], 5);
 * // => 4
